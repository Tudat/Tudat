Available Settings for the Environment Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here, we will provide a full list of the available properties of the :class:`BodySettings` object. Each type of environment model has one base class to define settings for the creation of the model). Often, a specific derived class is implemented for a specific environment model of a given class, in which any additional information that may be needed can be provided. For instance, when defining a gravity field model, one can simply use:

.. code-block:: cpp

    bodySettings[ "Earth" ]->gravityFieldSettings = boost::make_shared< GravityFieldSettings >( central_spice ); 

if you want to use a central gravity field with the gravitational parameter taken from Spice: no information is needed except the type of gravity field model that is created. On the other hand, if you want to use a spherical harmonic gravity field, you need to specify additional parameters yourself, which is done by using the specific derived class:

.. code-block:: cpp

    bodySettings[ "Earth" ]->gravityFieldSettings = boost::make_shared< SphericalHarmonicsGravityFieldSettings >( gravitationalParameter, referenceRadius, cosineCoefficients, sineCoefficients, associatedReferenceFrame ); 

To find out which input arguments must be provided to create a specific settings class, have a look at the documentation in the code (written above the code for the constructor of the settings class you are interested in). Below, we give examples of each type of environment model setting.

The full list of available environment model settings is described below.

Atmosphere model
****************

.. class:: AtmosphereModel

   Base class for all atmosphere models. This model is constructed using the settings classes described below.

.. class:: AtmosphereSettings

   The base class for atmosphere settings. Models currently available through the :class:`BodySettings` architecture are (with examples when defining settings for Earth):
    
.. class:: ExponentialAtmosphereSettings

   Simple atmosphere model independent of time, latitude and longitude based on an exponentially decaying density profile with a constant temperature.

   .. code-block:: cpp

      bodySettings[ "Earth" ]->atmosphereSettings = boost::make_shared< ExponentialAtmosphereSettings >( 7.2E3, 290.0, 1.225, 287.06 ); 

   for an exponential atmosphere with a scale height of 7200 m, a constant temperature of 290 K, a density at 0 m altitude of 1.225 kg/m^3 and a specific gas constant of 287.06 J/(kg K).

   If you want to model the exponential atmosphere for Earth or Mars, you can also simply input :literal:`aerodynamics::earth` or :literal:`aerodynamics::mars` to load the default settings, which are defined in the table below. 

      ============================  ==========  ==========  ==========

.. class:: TabulatedAtmosphereSettings

   Due to the extensive customization available for the tabulated atmosphere, you can find the settings for this class in a separate page: :ref:`tudatTabulatedAtmosphere`.

.. class:: CustomConstantTemperatureAtmosphereSettings

   With this class, you can define your own constant temperature atmosphere, which computes the atmospheric properties based on an input function. For instance, one can link a function to the settings as such:

   .. code-block:: cpp

      // Outside main
      double customDensityFunction( const double altitude, const double longitude, const double latitude, const double time )
      {
         // Return a linear combination of the input values
         return 0.5 * altitude + 0.25 * longitude + 0.15 * latitude + 0.1 * time;
      }

      int main( )
      {
        // ...

        // Define atmosphere settings
        double constantTemperature = 250.0;
        double specificGasConstant = 300.0;
        double ratioOfSpecificHeats = 1.4;
        bodySettings[ "Earth" ]->atmosphereSettings = boost::make_shared< CustomConstantTemperatureAtmosphereSettings >( &customDensityFunction, constantTemperature, specificGasConstant, ratioOfSpecificHeats ); 

        // ...
      }

   As shown in the example above, the user-defined function, in this case :literal:`customDensityFunction`, is required to have those inputs, and in that specific order. The value of pressure is computed by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, whereas temperature, gas constant and the ratio of specific heats are assumed to be constant. 

   .. tip ::
      Note that, by using :literal:`boost::bind`, you can have more inputs than the ones in :literal:`customDensityFunction`. However, keep in mind that :literal:`boost::bind` only allows up to 9 inputs. 

.. method:: NRLMSISE-00 
    
   This can be used to select the NRLMSISE-00 atmosphere model. To use this model, the :literal:`USE_NRLMSISE` flag in your top-level :literal:`CMakeLists` must be set to true. No derived class of :class:`AtmosphereSettings` base class required, the model can be created by passing :literal:`nrlmsise00` as argument to base class constructor. 

   .. code-block:: cpp

      bodySettings[ "Earth" ]->atmosphereSettings = boost::make_shared< AtmosphereSettings >( nrlmsise00 );  

.. class:: CustomWindModelSettings

   Custom wind model which can be used to retrieve a wind vector. This wind vector is in the body-fixed, body-centered reference frame. 

   .. code-block:: cpp
   
      bodySettings[ "Earth" ]->atmosphereSettings = boost::make_shared< CustomWindModelSettings >(  windFunction )
   
   where ``windFunction`` is a ``boost::function`` with inputs; altitude, longitude, latitude and time (for more details about boost: :ref:`externalBoost`).

Ephemeris model
****************  

.. class:: Ephemeris
  
   Base class for the ephemeris. It is constructed using one of the settings classes below.

.. class:: EphemerisSettings

   Base class for the ephemeris settings. Models currently available through the :class:`BodySettings` architecture and set by their respective derived classes are:

.. class:: ApproximatePlanetPositionSettings

   Highly simplified model of ephemerides of major Solar system bodies (model described here). Both a three-dimensional, and circular coplanar approximation may be used. 

   .. code-block:: cpp

       bodySettings[ "Jupiter" ]->ephemerisSettings = boost::make_shared< ApproximatePlanetPositionSettings >( ephemerides::ApproximatePlanetPositionsBase::jupiter, false ); 

   where the first constructor argument is taken from the enum in approximatePlanetPositionsBase.h, and the second argument (false) denotes that the circular coplanar approximation is not made.

.. class:: DirectSpiceEphermerisSettings

   Ephemeris retrieved directly using :ref:`tudatFeaturesSpice`.

   .. code-block:: cpp

       std::string frameOrigin = "SSB";
       std::string frameOrientation = "J2000";
       bodySettings[ "Jupiter" ]->ephemerisSettings = boost::make_shared< DirectSpiceEphemerisSettings >( frameOrigin, frameOrientation ); 

   creating a barycentric (SSB) ephemeris with axes along J2000, with data directly from spice.

.. class:: InterpolatedSpiceEphemerisSettings 
      
   Using this option the state of the body is retrieved at regular intervals, and used to create an interpolator, before setting up environment. This has the advantage of only requiring calls to Spice outside of the propagation inner loop, reducing computation time. However, it has the downside of begin applicable only during a limited time interval.

   .. code-block:: cpp

       double initialTime = 0.0;
       double finalTime = 1.0E8;
       double timeStep = 3600.0;
       std::string frameOrigin = "SSB";
       std::string frameOrientation = "J2000";
       bodySettings[ "Jupiter" ]->ephemerisSettings = boost::make_shared< InterpolatedSpiceEphemerisSettings >(
           initialTime, finalTime, timeStep, frameOrigin, frameOrientation ); 

   creating a barycentric (SSB) ephemeris with axes along J2000, with data retrieved from Spice at 3600 s intervals between t=0 and t=1.0E8, using a 6th order Lagrange interpolator. Settings for the interpolator (discussed here, can be added as a sixth argument if you wish to use a different interpolation method)

.. class:: TabulatedEphemerisSettings

   Ephemeris created directly by interpolating user-specified states as a function of time.

   .. code-block:: cpp

       std::map< double, Eigen::Vector6d > bodyStateHistory ...
       std::string frameOrigin = "SSB";
       std::string frameOrientation = "J2000";
       bodySettings[ "Jupiter" ]->ephemerisSettings = boost::make_shared< TabulatedEphemerisSettings >(
           bodyStateHistory, frameOrigin, frameOrientation ); 

   creating an ephemeris interpolated (with 6th order Lagrange interpolation) from the data in bodyStateHistory, which contains the Cartesian state (w.r.t. SSB; axes along J2000) for a given number of times (map keys, valid time range between first and last time in this map). 

.. class::  KeplerEphemerisSettings

   Ephemeris modelled as being a perfect Kepler orbit. 

   .. code-block:: cpp

       Eigen::Vector6d initialStateInKeplerianElements = ...
       double epochOfInitialState = ...
       double centralBodyGravitationalParameter = ...
       std::string frameOrigin = "SSB";
       std::string frameOrientation = "J2000";
       bodySettings[ "Jupiter" ]->ephemerisSettings = boost::make_shared< KeplerEphemerisSettings >(
           initialStateInKeplerianElements, epochOfInitialState, centralBodyGravitationalParameter, frameOrigin, frameOrientation ); 

   creating a Kepler orbit as ephemeris using the given kepler elements and associated initial time and gravitational parameter. See :ref:`tudatFeaturesFrameStateTransformations` for more details on orbital elements in Tudat.

.. class:: ConstantEphemerisSettings

   Ephemeris modelled as being independent of time.

   .. code-block:: cpp

       Eigen::Vector6d constantCartesianState = ...
       std::string frameOrigin = "SSB";
       std::string frameOrientation = "J2000";
       bodySettings[ "Jupiter" ]->ephemerisSettings = boost::make_shared< ConstantEphemerisSettings >(
           constantCartesianState, frameOrigin, frameOrientation ); 

.. method:: Multi-arc ephemeris

   An ephemeris model (for translational state) that allows the body’s state to be defined by distinct ephemeris models over different arcs. Class is implemented to support multi-arc propagation/estimation. No derived class of :class:`EphemerisSettings` base class required, the created ephemeris can be made multi-arc by using the ``resetMakeMultiArcEphemeris`` function of the :class:`EphemerisSettings` class. The resulting :class:`Ephemeris` object will then be :class:`MultiArcEphemeris` (with the same ephemeris model for each arc when created, according to the settings in the :class:`EphemerisSettings` object)

   .. code-block:: cpp

      bodySettings[ "Earth" ]->ephemerisSettings-> resetMakeMultiArcEphemeris( true );   

.. class:: CustomEphemerisSettings

   Allows user to provide arbitrary boost function as ephemeris model. 

   .. code-block:: cpp

      boost::shared_ptr< EphemerisSettings > customEphemerisSettings =
                   boost::make_shared< CustomEphemerisSettings >(
                      customBoostFunction, frameOrigin, frameOrientation );
