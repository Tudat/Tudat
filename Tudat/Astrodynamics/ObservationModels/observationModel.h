/*!
 *  Base class for models of observables to be used in (for instance) orbit determination.
 *  Each type of observables (1-way range, 2-way range, Doppler, VLBI, etc.) has its own
 *  derived class capable of simulating observables of the given type using given link ends.
 *  The functions to be used for computing the observables can be called with/without deviations from ideal observable
 *  (see base class member functions). Corrections are computed from an observationBiasCalculator member object, which is
 *  empty by default. Also, the observable may be a with/without returning (by reference) the times and states
 *  at each of the link ends. Returning these times/states prevents recomputations of these quantities in later calculations.
